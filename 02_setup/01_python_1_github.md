[Github](https://www.github.com) is a website that uses `git` which is the version control system. So, as we said before `git` keeps track of the changes you've made to your files/project. [Github](https://www.github.com) is used to keep those files with the tracking online. So, it's basically like uploading your files online but with a twist.

Start by opening www.github.com and register. I'll wait for you to finish....

So, now that you have an account, you can even login in codeunicorn using your github account. Try it out...

Now we're done from github, but we'll get back to it later.
